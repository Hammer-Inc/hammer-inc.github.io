As I began designing pages I realized Minima just was not the right fit for this kind of site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a ton of researching themes but for some reason could not find one that fit my needs.
I’ve copied the minima theme and have begun making changes to the styling and layouts.
Hopefully this will prove to be a fruitfull experiment but that remains to be seen&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Avrami Hammer</name></author><summary type="html">So… I’ve decided to branch away from the minima theme, Initially I really liked how the site looked with minima.

&lt;p&gt;The blog is built on Jekyll and hosted by github pages (unlike my normal cloudserver/cloudflare stack), 
I’ll take the time in the near future to go over what was involved in building this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I’ve added a page with some of my personal projects, feel free to browse!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Avrami Hammer</name></author><summary type="html">Today this blog goes live, it’s been a while in the making, a lot of procrastination has gone into this site behind the scenes and I’m glad it’s finally working.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to my Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/update/general/2019/01/02/welcome.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to my Blog" /><published>2019-01-02T21:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2019-01-02T21:00:00+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/update/general/2019/01/02/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/update/general/2019/01/02/welcome.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello There,&lt;/p&gt;
