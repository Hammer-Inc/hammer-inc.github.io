Incode is an education-centric project born out of a subject I took during my second semester at RMIT.

While researching a form of error correction, known as a 'Hamming Code', I was unable to find any sites which made the calculation of the error
correction code easy to understand. I took it upon myself to build a site that took students through the calculation step by step.

The project is built using a React/MaterialUI frontend plus a Flask backend
(As the calculation code was submitted as an assignment It can't be served to the client).
