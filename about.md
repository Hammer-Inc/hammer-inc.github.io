About Me
--------
I'm Avrami, a Computer Science student currently studying at RMIT university.
My hobbies include playing video games and building things when I see a need for them.

I have 2 years experience working in the industry at the technology services department of RMIT.

I'm also the 2019 president for the RMIT CSIT Society, the largest academic club within the school of CSIT at RMIT.

For more information on things I've done, see <https://cv.avrami.me>

About this site
-------
This site is built on Jekyll and served by Github Pages behind CloudFlare.

I built this site as a need arose to have somewhere to document/write up various projects I completed (outside my resume that is).

If you have any queries about this site or simply want to chat you can reach me at <{{ site.email }}>
