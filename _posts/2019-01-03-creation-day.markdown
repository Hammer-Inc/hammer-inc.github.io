Today this blog goes live, it's been a while in the making, a lot of procrastination has gone into this site behind the scenes and I'm glad it's finally working.

The blog is built on Jekyll and hosted by github pages (unlike my normal cloudserver/cloudflare stack), 
I'll take the time in the near future to go over what was involved in building this site.


In the mean time, I've added a page with some of my personal projects, feel free to browse!
