I've spent a decent chunk of time redesigning the styling and layout of the site to make it more modification friendly.
Additionally, you may have noticed a new menu item called 'Light', clicking it will toggle night/dark mode making 
the site more friendly to view for my late-night development sessions.

Thanks for taking a look and I hope you enjoy playing around with the new features!
