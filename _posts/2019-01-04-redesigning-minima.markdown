So... I've decided to branch away from the minima theme, Initially I really liked how the site looked with minima.
As I began designing pages I realized Minima just was not the right fit for this kind of site.

I did a ton of researching themes but for some reason could not find one that fit my needs.
I've copied the minima theme and have begun making changes to the styling and layouts.
Hopefully this will prove to be a fruitfull experiment but that remains to be seen
